abstract: |
  Natural history collections are part of our global heritage and a priceless resource for research and education. (https://spnhc.org/what-spnhc-does/)  Information about the contents of Natural History Collections may be captured in datasets and published digitally via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) (https://www.gbif.org/ipt) as Darwin Core Archives (DwC-A) (https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/dwca-guide#what-is-darwin-core-archive-dwc-a). We present a review and archiving process for such an openly accessible digital dataset of known origin and discuss its outcome. The dataset under review, named _insert_, has fingerprint _insert_, is _insert_ in size and contains _insert_ occurences with _insert_ unique taxon names. This report includes summaries of collection statistics, taxonomic context, geographic context, temporal context, and an archived version of the dataset from which the reviews are derived.

# Introduction



## Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin Core Archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations about, the dataset under review:

: Tools used in this review process

The review process can be described in the form of the script below ^[Note that you have to first get the data (e.g., via elton pull AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions) before being able to generate reviews (e.g., elton review AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions), extract interaction claims (e.g., elton interactions AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions), or list taxonomic names (e.g., elton names AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions)].

~~~
# get versioned copy of the dataset (size approx. 2.94MiB) under review 
elton pull AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions

# generate review notes
elton review AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions\
 > review.tsv

## Collection Statistics

![Biotic Interaction Data Model](interaction.svg)

In this review, collection statistics are modeled as Darwin Core values. In addition, metadata provided by the collection is reviewed for compliance with the Latimer Core Standard for describing collections (https://github.com/tdwg/ltc/wiki/1.-Overview-of-Latimer-Core). "Latimer Core has been developed to fill this gap: it is designed to be a flexible, sustainable framework of terms that can be assembled to create records that accurately represent a grouping of objects at any level of granularity, from an entire collection of an institution to a few objects in a single drawer." 

The dataset under review, named _insert_, is _insert_ in size and contains _insert occurence records with _insert_ unique taxon names (e.g., Fraxinus excelsior).

An exhaustive list of occurences can be found in gzipped [csv](indexed-interactions.csv.gz), [tsv](indexed-interactions.tsv.gz) and [parquet](indexed-interactions.parquet) archives. To facilitate discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at [indexed-interactions.html.gz](indexed-interactions.html.gz) are shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries below.

## Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process, detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this review can be found below.

## GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset under review. 

![Picture of a GloBI Review Badge ^[Up-to-date status of the GloBI Review Badge can be retrieved from the [GloBI Review Depot](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions/review.svg)]](review.svg) 

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with interpreting the species interaction data.

## GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been [registered with GloBI](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/contribute), and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived data products. 

![Picture of a GloBI Index Badge ^[Up-to-date status of the GloBI Index Badge can be retrieved from [GloBI's API](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction.svg?interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&accordingTo=globi:AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions&refutes=true&refutes=false)]](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction.svg?interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&accordingTo=globi:AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions&refutes=true&refutes=false)

# Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated way, while also including some information about the contents of the dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is important to note that this review does *not* assess the quality of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness[^2] and FAIRness [@Wilkinson_2016; @trekels_maarten_2023_8176978] of the dataset: to perform this review, the data was likely openly available, **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with specified measurement units. 

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable (meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles [@Wilkinson_2016]. Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.
